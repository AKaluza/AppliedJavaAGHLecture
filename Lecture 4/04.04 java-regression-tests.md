# Regression Tests in Java

## Introduction
Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures that new code changes have not adversely affected the existing functionalities of a software application. It is a crucial step in the software development lifecycle to maintain software quality after updates, enhancements, or bug fixes.

## Objectives
- Understand regression testing and its importance in software development.
- Learn how to implement regression tests in Java.
- Explore examples and code snippets to solidify understanding.
- Review references for deeper insights into regression testing.

## What is Regression Testing?
Regression testing involves the re-running of functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs correctly after a change. Changes that may necessitate regression testing include enhancements, patches, and configuration changes.

### Importance
- **Ensures Stability:** Maintains software quality.
- **Detects Breakages:** Identifies unintended consequences of code modifications.
- **Facilitates Continuous Delivery:** Supports agile practices by ensuring smooth integration.

## Types of Regression Testing
1. **Unit Regression Testing:** Tests isolated units or code without dependencies.
2. **Partial Regression Testing:** Ensures that the new code works seamlessly with the existing code.
3. **Complete Regression Testing:** Involves testing the entire application from scratch.

## Implementing Regression Tests in Java
Java, being a robust and widely-used programming language, offers several approaches and frameworks for implementing regression tests.

### Frameworks and Libraries
- **JUnit:** A simple, powerful tool for unit testing in Java.
- **TestNG:** A testing framework inspired by JUnit but with more advanced features.
- **Selenium:** Used for automating web applications for testing purposes, often used in conjunction with JUnit or TestNG for GUI testing.

## Tools for Regression Testing in Java
1. **JUnit** 
   - Pros: Simple setup, seamless integration with Java IDEs.
   - Cons: Limited support for dependency testing.
   
2. **TestNG**
   - Pros: Flexible, supports parameterized testing.
   - Cons: Slightly more complex setup compared to JUnit.
   
3. **Selenium**
   - Pros: Excellent for web-based application testing.
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve for complex scenarios.

## Example Code
### JUnit Example
Here's a simple regression test using JUnit:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3), "2 + 3 should equal 5");
    }
}
```

### TestNG Example
A similar test with TestNG:

```java
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        Assert.assertEquals(calc.add(2, 3), 5, "2 + 3 should equal 5");
    }
}
```

## Best Practices
- **Automate Regression Tests:** Minimize resource consumption by automating recurring tests.
- **Maintain Test Cases:** Regularly update your test suite to accommodate new features and changes.
- **Prioritize Tests:** Focus more on critical areas of the application first.
- **Continuous Integration:** Use CI tools like Jenkins to automatically run your regression tests.
