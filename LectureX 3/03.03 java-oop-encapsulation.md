### Introduction

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), alongside inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. This unit is called an **object**, and it acts as a container hiding its internal implementation details from the outside world.

**Think of a capsule:** It contains different ingredients enclosed within its shell. Similarly, in encapsulation, data and methods are enclosed within the object.

### Key Concepts

* **Data Hiding:** Encapsulation restricts direct access to an object's internal data (variables) from outside the object. This is achieved using access modifiers like `private`.
* **Abstraction:**  Encapsulation allows us to expose only the necessary information about an object through well-defined methods, hiding the complex implementation details. This is achieved using public methods, often called "getters" and "setters."

### Benefits of Encapsulation

* **Increased Security:** Hiding data within an object protects it from accidental or unauthorized modification.
* **Code Reusability:** Encapsulated objects can be easily reused in different parts of the application or even in other applications.
* **Improved Maintainability:** Changes made to an object's internal implementation won't affect other parts of the program, as long as the public interface remains consistent.
* **Reduced Complexity:** Encapsulation breaks down complex systems into smaller, more manageable units, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### Implementing Encapsulation in Java

Java provides access modifiers to control the visibility of variables and methods. 

**Access Modifiers:**

| Modifier    | Within Class | Within Package | Within Subclass | Globally |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| `public`     | Yes        | Yes              | Yes             | Yes       |
| `protected` | Yes        | Yes              | Yes             | No        |
| *no modifier (default)* | Yes        | Yes              | No              | No        |
| `private`    | Yes        | No               | No              | No        |

**Example:**

```java
public class Person {
    // Private data members
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Public getter method for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter method for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Public getter method for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Public setter method for age with validation
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 0) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age cannot be negative.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* The `name` and `age` variables are declared as `private`. They can only be accessed from within the `Person` class.
* Public getter and setter methods are provided to access and modify the values of the private variables. 
* The `setAge` method demonstrates how encapsulation enables data validation before modification.

**Using the Encapsulated Class:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setName("Alice");
        person.setAge(30);

        System.out.println("Name: " + person.getName());
        System.out.println("Age: " + person.getAge());
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Name: Alice
Age: 30
```
