## Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Welcome to the exciting world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java! This presentation will delve into the core principles of OOP, specifically focusing on their implementation in the Java programming language. We'll explore concepts through clear explanations, illustrative examples, and practical code snippets. 

Let's get started!

### What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects**, which are instances of **classes**. Think of it as building with Lego blocks:

* **Objects:**  Individual Lego creations (e.g., a car, a house) built using the blocks.
* **Classes:** The blueprints or molds that define the structure and behavior of those Lego creations.

OOP promotes:
* **Modularity:** Code is organized into self-contained units (classes), making it easier to manage and reuse.
* **Flexibility:** Objects can be easily modified and extended without affecting other parts of the code.
* **Reusability:**  Classes can be reused to create multiple objects, saving time and effort.

### Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Abstraction:** Representing complex reality in a simplified model, focusing on essential features.
    * **Example:** A `Car` object abstracts a real car, focusing on properties like `model`, `color`, and methods like `start()` and `stop()`.

2. **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on that data within a class, hiding internal complexities.
    * **Example:**  The `engine` of a `Car` is encapsulated. Users interact with the car through methods like `start()` without needing to know the engine's internal workings.

3. **Inheritance:** Creating new classes (child classes) from existing ones (parent classes), inheriting their properties and behaviors.
    * **Example:** A `SportsCar` class can inherit from the `Car` class, inheriting properties like `model` and methods like `start()`, while adding specialized features like a `turboBoost()` method.

4. **Polymorphism:**  The ability of an object to take on many forms. This allows methods to be overridden in subclasses to provide specific implementations.
    * **Example:** Both a `Car` and a `Bicycle` can have an `accelerate()` method, but they will implement it differently.

### OOP Concepts in Java:

Let's illustrate these concepts with Java code:

```java
// Abstraction & Encapsulation: Defining a Car class


class Car {
    // Attributes (encapsulated)
    private String model;
    private String color;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String model, String color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    // Methods (defining behavior)
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println(color + " " + model + " starting...");
    }
    
    

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println(color + " " + model + " stopping.");
    }
}

// Inheritance: Creating a SportsCar subclass
class SportsCar extends Car {
    // Additional attribute
    private boolean turboEnabled;

    // Constructor
    public SportsCar(String model, String color) {
        super(model, color); // Calls the parent class constructor
        this.turboEnabled = false; 
    }

    // Additional method
    public void enableTurbo() {
        this.turboEnabled = true;
        System.out.println("Turbo enabled!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects
        Car myCar = new Car("Honda", "Silver");
        SportsCar mySportsCar = new SportsCar("Ferrari", "Red");

        // Polymorphism: Calling the same method on different objects
        myCar.start(); 
        mySportsCar.start(); 
        mySportsCar.enableTurbo(); 
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Silver Honda starting...
Red Ferrari starting...
Turbo enabled! 
```

### Key Takeaways:

* OOP models real-world entities as objects with properties and behaviors.
* Java provides robust support for implementing OOP principles.
* Understanding these concepts is crucial for building well-structured, maintainable, and reusable Java applications.
