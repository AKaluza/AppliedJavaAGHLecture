## Java Comments: Making Your Code Speak

Welcome to this lecture on Java comments! While code tells the computer what to do, comments are our way of talking to ourselves and other developers. They explain **why** and **how**, making code easier to understand and maintain.

### Single-line Comments: Short and Sweet

Single-line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line. They're perfect for:

* **Brief explanations:** Clarifying a single line of code.
* **Disabling code:** Temporarily removing code during testing.

**Example:**

```java
public class CommentsExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This line prints a greeting to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, world!"); 

        // This line was used for testing, but is no longer needed
        // int x = 5; 
    }
}
```

**Best Practices:**

* Keep comments concise and focused on the "why", not the "what".
* Align comments consistently for readability.

### Multi-line Comments: Telling the Story

Multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/` and can span multiple lines. They're ideal for:

* **Detailed explanations:** Describing complex logic or algorithms.
* **Class and method documentation:** Providing an overview and usage instructions (more on this in Javadoc).

**Example:**

```java
public class AreaCalculator {

    /*
     * This method calculates the area of a rectangle.
     *
     * @param length The length of the rectangle.
     * @param width  The width of the rectangle.
     * @return      The calculated area of the rectangle.
     */
    public int calculateArea(int length, int width) {
        return length * width;
    }
}
```

**Important Note:** 

* Avoid nested multi-line comments as they can lead to compilation errors.

### Javadoc Comments: Generating Documentation

Javadoc comments are a special type of multi-line comment used to generate documentation in HTML format. They start with `/**` and end with `*/`, and can include special tags for documenting parameters, return values, exceptions, and more.

**Example:**

```java
/**
 * This class represents a bank account with basic functionalities.
 * 
 * @author John Doe
 * @version 1.0
 */
public class BankAccount {

    /**
     * The account holder's name.
     */
    private String accountHolder;

    /**
     * The current balance of the account.
     */
    private double balance;

    /**
     * Deposits the specified amount into the account.
     * 
     * @param amount The amount to deposit.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the deposit amount is negative.
     */
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Deposit amount cannot be negative.");
        }
        balance += amount;
    }
    // ... other methods with Javadoc comments ...
}
```

**Generating Javadoc Documentation:**

You can generate HTML documentation from Javadoc comments using the `javadoc` tool included in the Java Development Kit (JDK).

**Further Resources:**

* **Oracle's Javadoc Documentation:** [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html)
* **Java Programming Language (book) by Arnold, Gosling, and Holmes**

**Key Takeaways:**

* Comments are crucial for code maintainability and collaboration.
* Choose the right comment type based on the context and purpose.
* Javadoc comments allow you to generate professional documentation for your code.

By mastering the art of commenting, you'll write cleaner, more understandable code that will make you a better Java developer.
